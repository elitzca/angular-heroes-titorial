Angular needs to know how the pieces of your application fit together
and what other files and libraries the app requires. This information is called metadata

Some of the metadata is in the @Component decorators that you added to your component classes.
Other critical metadata is in @NgModule decorators.


0.0 The Application Shell
    You created the initial application structure using the Angular CLI.
    You learned that Angular components display data.
    You used the double curly braces of interpolation to display the app title.

1.1 The Hero Editor
    You used the CLI to create a second HeroesComponent.
    You displayed the HeroesComponent by adding it to the AppComponent shell.
    You applied the UppercasePipe to format the name.
    You used two-way data binding with the ngModel directive.
    You learned about the AppModule.
    You imported the FormsModule in the AppModule so that Angular would recognize and apply the ngModel directive.
    You learned the importance of declaring components in the AppModule and appreciated that the CLI declared it for you.
